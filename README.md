# NetPractice Network Configuration Project

Welcome to the NetPractice Network Configuration Project! This project involves solving networking problems to make a network run correctly. You will complete a series of exercises that require configuring networks to meet specific goals. Each level presents a non-functioning network diagram, and you will need to adjust the configuration to make the network operational.

## Getting Started

### Setup

1. **Download the Files:** Begin by downloading the file attached to the project’s page.
2. **Extract the Files:** Extract the contents of the downloaded file into your desired folder.
3. **Run the Interface:** Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. This will launch the NetPractice training interface.

### Interface Overview

- **Login Field:** Enter your login if you want to practice. Leave the field empty to use the ‘correction’ version.
- **Levels:** There are 10 levels of network configuration exercises. Each level presents a network diagram and a goal to achieve.
- **Buttons:**
  - **Check Again:** Use this button to verify if your configuration is correct.
  - **Get My Config:** Download your configuration for submission or review.

### Completing the Exercises

1. **Configuration:** For each level, modify the unshaded fields in the network diagram to resolve issues and meet the goal specified at the top of the window.
2. **Verification:** Click the "Check Again" button to test if your configuration is correct.
3. **Export Configuration:** Once a level is successfully completed, click on the new button that appears to proceed to the next level. Make sure to export your configuration using the "Get My Config" button for each level and save the configuration file.
4. **Submission:** Upload the JSON files containing your configurations to your Git repository.

### Files

- **`level1.json`, `level2.json`, ..., `level10.json`:** JSON files containing the configurations for each level. Ensure these files are correctly named and include the configurations you used to solve each level.

### Example

For example, if you completed Level 1 and exported your configuration, you would have a file named `level1.json` with the correct settings. This file should be included in your repository for submission.

### Additional Information

- **Logs:** At the bottom of the NetPractice interface, you will see logs that can help diagnose issues with your configuration.
- **Learning Resources:** To better understand TCP/IP addressing and network configuration, consider reading about networking concepts, specifically TCP/IP addressing and routing.

### Compilation and Submission

1. **Ensure all levels are completed:** Make sure you have completed all 10 levels and saved the JSON files.
2. **Verify Configurations:** Double-check that each configuration file corresponds to the correct level and is properly formatted.
3. **Push to Repository:** Commit and push all JSON configuration files to your Git repository.

### License

This project does not include a specific license but adheres to standard academic and project submission guidelines. Ensure that you follow any additional requirements set by your educational institution or project guidelines.
